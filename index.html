Have you been considering installing an ATM at your retail location? Then listen up! Choose FastCash ATM and see the benefits for yourself. Having a FastCash ATM in your store will boost revenue, increase customer traffic and satisfaction, and eliminate credit card processing fees, all at no cost or maintenance for you.
	Your company will gain revenue by using FastCash ATM’s. On average, ATM users will spend 50% of their withdrawal at the store in which the ATM was located. This means that more customers will purchase goods from your store if they’re coming in to use the ATM. This revenue boost is compounded when the amount of money each customer will spend is factored in – ATM users generally spend 25% more money than non-ATM users. Therefore, not only will these ATM users be purchasing your goods, they’ll be spending more as they do so! FastCash ATM’s will increase your revenue in multiple ways.
	Along with an increased profit, your company will see higher customer satisfaction and traffic with a FastCash ATM installed. Having an ATM conveniently located inside your store will make transactions easier for your customers, leaving them satisfied with your service. In fact, 70% of all bank transactions are done through ATM’s. That also means more people flocking to the nearest machine to do their business – which then means more business for you!
	Processing fees for credit cards will be greatly reduced by having an ATM. With many of your consumers using the ATM, they will pay in cash more often. Subsequently, your business will forgo processing fees and credit card fees. The average credit card user will reduce their fees by 20%. This way, both your business and the consumer benefit from a FastCash ATM.
	Perhaps all these benefits seem too good to be true – what’s the catch? Well, clearly, FastCash ATMs have to be filled and maintained, and customer service will be needed. Fortunately for you, FastCash provides all of these services at no extra cost to you! FastCash fills and maintains its own ATMs, and even offers customer service to its users. The business itself thus puts no effort into it, receiving only the benefit.
	Finally, to top it all off, FastCash ATM’s are absolutely free to install. Not only do they require no effort to maintain, but they are also completely free of charge. Your business pays nothing, and FastCash will provide an ATM for you at your location. Once again, there is no cost – in money or time – to the business, only benefit.
	Getting a FastCash ATM installed at your retail location will increase your profit as well as your customer satisfaction and traffic; processing fees will be nearly eliminated, and all of this comes at no cost to your business. As you can see, FastCash ATM’s are a valuable addition to any store, so call us today and get yours installed!
